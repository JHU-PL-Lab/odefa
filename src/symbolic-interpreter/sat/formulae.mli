    collection.  This is not guaranteed to be thrown in all contradictory
    circumstances; it is thrown when the intersection of types assigned to a
    symbol produces the empty set. *)

(** An exception which is raised if an inconsistent pair if immediate
    assignments is added to a collection.  This is not guaranteed to be thrown
    in all contradictory circumstances; it is only thrown when two immediately
    contradictory value assignments (e.g. x = 4 and x = 6) attempt to
    coexist. *)

(** Retrieves the inferred type of a symbol in a collection.  If None is
    returned, the symbol has no fixed type; this may occur if a symbol has been
    introduced via a formula but has never been constrained.  Raises Not_found
    if the symbol has never been introduced. *)
