(** This module defines a solver for the constraints emitted by the symbolic
    interpreter.  This solver performs two types of checks.  As constraints are
    added, they are checked for immediate or relatively obvious contradictions
    (e.g. x = 4 and x = 6).  Later, a user may call the solve routine to check
    for all forms of contradiction (e.g. x < 2 and x > 4).  Solvers are provided
    via a persistent (immutable) interface. *)

(** A description of contradictions which may appear during the closure of a
    constraint set.  Each constructor represents a different contradiction case:

      * the inclusion of two dissonant stack constraints
      * the assignment of dissonant types to a particular symbol
      * the assignment of distinct values to a particular symbol
      * the assignment to a symbol of a record projection using a label that the
        subject does not contain
