(**
   This module defines a monad used by the symbolic interpreter.  This monad
   provides the following computational properties:

   * Non-determinism (for choices on e.g. wiring nodes)
   * State within (rather than across) non-determinism (to track decisions and
     constraints)
   * SAT checks on collected constraints
   * Stepping incrementally through computation

   To support incremental stepping, this monad's data type is essentially a free
   monad: binds and returns both produce suspended structures with sufficient
   metadata to support the other features.  This monad also provides an
   evaluation stepping routine to allow it to be incrementally evaluated.
