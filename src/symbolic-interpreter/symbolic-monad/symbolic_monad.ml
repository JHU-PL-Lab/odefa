(*
The implementation of this monad includes the following features:

  * Suspension via coroutine
  * Logging via writer (with sanity checking via a "listen"-like mechanism)
  * Nondeterminism via lists
  * State for caching common computations

Note that nondeterminism doesn't play nicely with most other features.  Using
transformers, it is possible to produce nondeterminism *independent* of other
features, but we want the features to interact.  In the event that incoherent
logs are written (e.g. conflicting decisions in function wiring choices), for
example, we want computation to zero.  This requires us to customize the monad
rather than relying on transformer definitions.
