# Todo
1. Add interpreter support for extended grammar
  * Input
  * Formulae/predicates
  * Iota dictionary - maps program points (identifiers to values (start with ints))
  * The iota dictionary will be blank at first. First implement formula tracking
2. Extend interpreter to keep track of formulae
3. Make bare-bones, really simple examples
4. Implement support for simplest rules and work up to the more subtle, complex rules.

currently trying to figure out how to implement the iota dictionary passing and Formulae
was trying to go down rules one by one
Not sure how to evaluate formula
