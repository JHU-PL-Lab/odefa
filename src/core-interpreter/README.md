still haven't seen an example where substitution is necessary

x=1;
y=2;
....
final = x;

and to start from that node, find it in the graph and call lookup from there.

non-determinism points
binary op
input
function enter

What I have:
a program that takes a simplistic program as input and outputs the value and a formula

Things I need:
resolve the non-determinism and multiple values problem.
  do we simply return the first value that we find?
